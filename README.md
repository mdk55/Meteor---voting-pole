Wanna have your own Surivive Polls and see who is in the lead or what not? 

Thanks to #Collab project for CodeBuddies.org and this repo -- you can ! 

*IMPORTANT!*
When you first run the meteor server you will get an error, you have to ctrl+c
to close it and then run it again (it's a SASS compiler thing)

Also this code is somewhat stank in that the bootstrap3_scss is outdated and could use a fresh life since Meteor update to 1.3.
